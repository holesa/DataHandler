# DataHandler : manipulate data && finish your work faster
DataHandler is a handy React app where you can complete minor tasks such as removing duplications, counting characters, checking footprints on websites, and so on.

## Features:
* The app interface is very simple. The left column is for input data, the dropdown containing methods is in the middle and the right column is for output data. 
* Client side is built on React.
* Express.js based backend serves as a proxy for React and provides a few API endpoints for frontend needs.
* The temporal storage at the bottom is actually just an embedded google spreadsheet with a running script that clears the spreadsheet every 12 hours.
